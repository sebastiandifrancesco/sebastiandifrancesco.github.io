The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API (+500 cities).

We used matplotlib to plot lots of different aspects of the weather vs latitude. Factors included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site contains the source data and visualizations, explanations, and descriptions of any trends and correlations seen.
